# Subagents

Each subagent is headless, has its own context window, cannot see the parent conversation, cannot ask the user, and cannot spawn subagents or workflows. Give every child a self-contained prompt with paths, constraints, and the expected report.

## Pi-Only Harness

**Harness:** `pi`
**Prompt nicknames:** “pi”, “pi agent”, “pi subagent”
**Only supported harness:** `pi`. It inherits the parent model and thinking level when `model` or `reasoning_effort` is omitted. Claude Code and Codex CLI harnesses are disabled.

Do not use models from the Anthropic provider even if one appears in the model list.

Pi can use any model shown by `pi --list-models`. Prefer `provider/model-id`; a bare model id only works when unambiguous. Common picks in this environment:

| Model                            | Recommended effort |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| inherited parent model (default) | inherited          |
| `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`       | `high`             |
| `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra`     | `high`             |
| `opencode/claude-fable-5`        | `medium`           |

**Thinking budgets:** `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. These map directly to provider thinking levels. Parent `ultracode` inheritance is normalized to `xhigh`; child agents do not inherit workflow-orchestration mode.

## Spawn and Manage

Call `subagent_spawn` with a complete `prompt`, short `name`, and optional `working_dir`, `model`, and `reasoning_effort`. Harness is always `pi`. At most four subagents run concurrently.

- `subagent_check({ id })`: peek without blocking.
- `subagent_list()`: list all runs.
- `subagent_wait({ ids })`: block only when results are required to proceed.
- `subagent_cancel({ ids })`: stop runs while preserving partial transcripts.
- `/subagents`: inspect or take over a run interactively.

Results return automatically. After spawning, continue useful parent work instead of immediately waiting.
